            <p style='margin:15px;'>At Summer of Tech we believe the future of the country's technology industry is in the hands of the next generation. We connect employers with top local students and graduates for paid work experience and graduate jobs.
            <p style='margin:15px;'>Summer of Tech is a non-profit programme helping students and graduates enter the New Zealand IT industry. We have been finding, growing and matching New Zealandâ€™s tech talent with opportunities, since 2006.
