            <h3>Student Job Search</h3>

            <p>Kia ora, welcome to Student Job Search Aotearoa – the unique match-making service between employers and tertiary students.</p>

            <p>Student Job Search (SJS) is a registered not for profit charity and 100% student owned by Student Associations across the country. Established in 1982 by the (now) Ministry of Social Development, SJS aligns the needs of employers looking for their ideal employee/s with the needs of all tertiary students looking for work.</p>

            <p>Our mission is: “To enable every student that wants employment to secure employment that meets their immediate and potential long term vocational goals”.</p>

            <p>Since the millennium, SJS has matched students with over 400,000 jobs. Successive generations of students have gone on to become employers themselves and used us to find students to work for them, knowing that students are often the perfect solution to their needs. We can truly say that 35 years on and counting, we are part of New Zealand’s DNA.</p>

            <p>Our website typically hosts over 3,000 jobs at any one time. Our contact centre in Wellington is highly trained and professional, and regularly recognised for excellence in national contact centre benchmarking awards.</p>

            <p>We currently help students into over 27,000 jobs annually, collectively earning well over $80m per year. Jobs range from low-skilled manual labour to highly skilled technical roles, the length and breadth of New Zealand. We pride ourselves on our record, our professionalism and our outstanding customer service - yet we have only scratched the surface of what is possible. Under our fresh strategic plan, we will significantly increase student earnings and the number of placements each year.</p>

            <p>Why are we so confident? Partly because our legacy and our record gives us great foundations to build on. Partly because every day we’re in touch with employers and students from all over the country, seeing the value of what we do. And partly because we’re constantly improving our service even more.</p>
